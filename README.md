# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, welcome to my profile!

I make (weird) keyboards and code a bit.
Have fun here!

## What languages do I speak?
I am fluent in Python1 The learning journey for C++ is underway, but I think I can translate Python to C++ pretty well.<br>
My HTML/CSS is pretty good, but Javascript could certainly be better.<br>
Also, I've just ventured into the world of Flutter! Wish me luck!<br><br>
I also speak Chinese!
